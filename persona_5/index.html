    <p>Persona 5 is a fantasy based on reality which follows a group of troubled high school students: 
    the protagonist and a collection of compatriots he meets along the way. These disturbed and troubled 
    teenagers gradually realize that they are living in a toxic and dangerous world resembling a prison 
    full of slavery, oppression and injustice, ruled by corrupted and twisted adults. They can't live
    with the system and can't live without it, and simply existing means they are at risk of being 
    doomed and condemned to a life of slavery.
    <br><br>
    In order to seek freedom, liberation and justice, they live dual lives as rebellious Phantom Thieves 
    of Hearts. Using a mysterious smartphone app, they undertake fantastical adventures by using otherworldly 
    powers to enter the hearts of people (specifically, corrupt adults in positions of power) in order to
    re-shape and transform them. The Phantom Thieves realize that society forces people to wear masks to 
    protect their inner vulnerabilities, and by confronting their inner selves and by literally ripping 
    off their protective mask do the heroes awaken their inner power, using it to help those in need. 
    Ultimately, the group of Phantom Thieves seeks to change their day-to-day world to match their perception,
    end slavery and see through the masks modern society wears.
